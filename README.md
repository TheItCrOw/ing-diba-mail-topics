This repository contains my solution for the **ING-DiBa Senior Data Scientist Coding Challenge**.  
The goal was to analyze and classify the topics of approximately **630 customer emails** by leveraging state-of-the-art **NLP techniques** and **visual analytics**.

## üß† Project Overview

For the challenge, I designed a complete **end-to-end NLP pipeline** capable of:
- Discovering **latent topics** within the email corpus.
- Labeling individual sentences and entire documents with **topics**, **sentiment**, and **emotions**.
- Providing an **interactive exploration platform** for visualizing results.

To achieve this, I combined BERTopic, transformer-based NLP models, and the Docker Unified UIMA Interface (DUUI) from the [Text Technology Lab](https://www.texttechnologylab.org), resulting in a powerful, modular, and reusable pipeline.

## ‚öôÔ∏è NLP Pipeline with DUUI

The workflow for processing and analyzing the emails was as follows:

### 1. Train a BERTopic Model
- Created embeddings for all emails and trained a BERTopic model to identify clusters and underlying topics.  
- Experimented with hyperparameter tuning due to the small dataset size (~630 emails).  
- The trained model is published on Hugging Face: [**bertopic-german-mails-small**](https://huggingface.co/TheItCrOw/bertopic-german-mails-small)

> For details, see [`python/BERTopic.ipynb`](python/BERTopic.ipynb).

### 2. Transform Emails into UIMA Documents
- Converted raw emails into the **UIMA** format (*Unstructured Information Management Architecture*) for downstream NLP processing.

---

### 3. Define the NLP Pipeline
Using the [Docker Unified UIMA Interface](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/DockerUnifiedUIMAInterface), I built the following NLP pipeline:

- **spaCy** for tokenization, lemmatization, sentence splitting, dependency parsing, and Named-Entity Recognition (NER).
- The trained BERTopic model to label topics on a sentence level, with aggregated document-level classifications.

> Additionally, I thought it would be interesting in this context to do sentiment and emotion analysis. **What are the customers sentiment and emotions when talking about specific topics?**

- A [sentiment analysis component](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/duui-uima/tree/main/duui-transformers-sentiment-atomar) to classify positive, negative, or neutral tone per sentence.
- An [emotion detection component](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/duui-uima/tree/main/duui-transformers-Emotion) to capture fine-grained emotional signals.

All raw and processed UIMA documents are stored under the [`data`](data) directory.

## üåê Interactive Exploration with UCE

</p>

To make the analysis tangible and intuitive, I integrated the processed corpus into the [**Unified Corpus Explorer (UCE)**](https://github.com/texttechnologylab/UCE). This provides a fully featured web interface for navigating annotations, exploring topics, and visualizing patterns in the dataset.
